# CSS Basics – ALX Project

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Curriculum**, focusing on the basics of CSS and page layout using Flexbox.

## 📁 Directory: `css_basic`

### ✅ What This Project Includes:

- `index.html` – A portfolio-style homepage with content and layout.
- `tweets.html` – A simple tweets-like HTML page.
- `base.css` – Provided base styles for consistent layout and typography.
- `styles.css` – Custom styles added by me for improved visuals, colors, layout, and responsiveness.

### 🧠 Key Concepts Applied:

- CSS Flexbox layout:
  - `body` as a vertical flex container (`flex-direction: column`)
  - `main` as a horizontal flex container (`flex-direction: row`)
  - `article` takes 2/3 width, `aside` takes 1/3 width
- Mobile responsiveness using:
  - `<meta name="viewport">` tag
  - `.works_on_smartphone` class
- Unicode logo added in header
- Styled table with learners' data
- External image with a clickable link
- Scrollable `article` and `aside` sections with `overflow-y: auto`
